    "\n",
    "- Spark is a lightning-fast cluster computing technology, designed for fast computation. \n",
    "- It is based on Hadoop MapReduce and it extends the MapReduce model to efficiently use it for more types of computations, which includes interactive queries and stream processing. \n",
    "- The main feature of Spark is its in-memory cluster computing that increases the processing speed of an application. Spark also loaded data in-memory, making operations much faster than Hadoop’s on-disk storage.\n",
    "- Spark is designed to cover a wide range of workloads such as batch applications, iterative algorithms, interactive queries and streaming. "

    "### Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run workloads 100x faster. \n",
    "- Apache Spark achieves high performance for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG scheduler, a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.\n",

    "- **DataFrame** is a Dataset organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs. The DataFrame API is available in Scala, Java, Python, and R.\n",
    "- **Spark Streaming** leverages Spark Core's fast scheduling capability to perform streaming analytics. It ingests data in mini-batches and performs RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) transformations on those mini-batches of data.\n",
    "- **MLlib** is a distributed machine learning framework above Spark because of the distributed memory-based Spark architecture. It is, according to benchmarks, done by the MLlib developers against the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) implementations. Spark MLlib is nine times as fast as the Hadoop disk-based version of Apache Mahout (before Mahout gained a Spark interface).\n",
    "- **GraphX** a distributed graph-processing framework on top of Spark. It provides an API for expressing graph computation that can model the user-defined graphs by using Pregel abstraction API. It also provides an optimized runtime for this abstraction."

Although this framework provides numerous abstractions for accessing a cluster’s computational resources, users still want more.\n",
    "- Both Iterative and Interactive applications require faster data sharing across parallel jobs. Data sharing is slow in MapReduce due to replication, serialization, and disk IO. Regarding storage system, most of the Hadoop applications, they spend more than 90% of the time doing HDFS read-write operations."

The key idea of spark is Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD); it supports in-memory processing computation. This means, it stores the state of memory as an object across the jobs and the object is sharable between those jobs. Data sharing in memory is 10 to 100 times faster than network and Disk."
